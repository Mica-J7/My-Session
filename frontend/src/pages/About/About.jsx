      <p>
        My Session is a website designed to help you plan your strength training sessions. I'm a junior developer, and
        My Session is my first personal project. It will continue to evolve as I learn and grow. Many new features are
        on the way, and my goal is to eventually include other sports as well. For now, I'm focusing on weight training
        because it's the sport I practice myself â€” and I wanted to build a tool that meets my own needs.
